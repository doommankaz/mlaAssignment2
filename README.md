In this assignment we are prompted to create a dataset. In my example I have created a simple dataset which consists of 1500*6 entries.
There is only one categorized feature, three numerical features, target and a string feature.
3 numerical features correlate with the target as we can clearly see from the code. 
Also, all entries are unique.
